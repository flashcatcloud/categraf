# Keepalived

forked from [keepalived-exporter](https://github.com/mehdy/keepalived-exporter)

## Configuration

请参考配置[示例](../../conf/input.keepalived/keepalived.toml)

```
# # collect interval
# interval = 15

# Send SIGJSON and decode JSON file instead of parsing text files, defaults to `false`.
sig_json = false

# A path for Keepalived PID, defaults to `/var/run/keepalived.pid`
pid_path = ""

# Health Check script path to be execute for each VIP.
# Check Script Example:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#ping $1 -c 1 -W 1
check_script_path = ""

#This is when the keepalived is running with PID 1 in the container so we can use the standard docker API to send signal to the keepalived process.
# Keepalived container name to export metrics from Keepalived container.
container_name = ""

# In case the keepalived process is not running with PID 1, this method will exec to the container and use the provided PID path to send the signal.
container_pid_path = ""

# Keepalived container tmp volume path, defaults to `/tmp`.
container_tmp = ""
```

#### Using Docker Signal

This is when the keepalived is running with PID 1 in the container so we can use the standard docker API to send signal to the keepalived process.

```bash
docker run -v keepalived-data:/tmp/ ... $KEEPALIVED_IMAGE
```

#### Exec to container with PID path

In case the keepalived process is not running with PID 1, this method will exec to the container and use the provided PID path to send the signal.

```bash
docker run -v keepalived-data:/tmp/ -v keepalived-pid:/var/run/ ... $KEEPALIVED_IMAGE
```

## Check Script

You can specify a check script like Keepalived script check to check if all the things is okay or not.
The script will run for each VIP and gives an arg `$1` that contains VIP.

**Note:** The script should be executable.

```bash
chmod +x check_script.sh
```

### Sample Check Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
ping $1 -c 1 -W 1
```
