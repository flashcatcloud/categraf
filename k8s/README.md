# monitoring kubernetes control plane with plugin prometheus


## if your control plane is in pod, for example, you use kubeadm build k8s cluster. Then kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler and etcd need some extra work to be discovery.

### create service for kube-controller-manager
1. `kubectl apply -f controller-service.yaml` 
2. edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` , modify or add one line `- --bind-address=0.0.0.0`  
3. wait kube-controller-manager to restart
 
### create service for kube-scheduler
3. `kubectl apply -f scheduler-service.yaml`
4. edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` , modify or add one line `- --bind-address=0.0.0.0`
5. wait kube-scheduler to restart

### create service for etcd
6. `kubectl apply -f etcd-service-http.yaml`
7. edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` ,  modify `- --listen-metrics-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2381` to `- --listen-metrics-urls=http://0.0.0.0:2381`
8. wait etcd to restart

### create all other objects with deployment
9. edit deployment.yaml and modify it with your own configure.
 
   i. replace ${CATEGRAF_NAMESPACE} which located in ClusterRoleBinding part
 
   ii. replace ${NSERVER_SERVICE_WITH_PORT} which located in ConfigMap part config.toml and in_cluster_scrape.yaml

   if you choose `etcd-service.yaml` with https mode, then `kubectl apply -f etcd-service.yaml`.
 
   iii. replace `{data of your etcd ca file}` `{data of your etcd client cert file}` `{data of your etcd client key file}` in ConfigMap etcd-pki.

 
10. `kubectl apply -f  deployment-etcd-http.yaml -n monitoring`

Make sure that `deployment.yaml` always appears with `etcd-service.yaml` and `deployment-etcd-http` appears with `etcd-service-http.yaml`. They cannot be apply at the same time.
